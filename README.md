Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.

Here we will use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) DataSet. This dataset contains 569 patients with breast tumors. Several measurements and a diagnosis of malignant and benign are available for each patient. The measurements will be used as features to make our predictions on the diagnosis. 

The purpose of this Kernel is to develop a neural network that is capable of accurately predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant, given several measurements. For this purpose, first we will analyze this dataset and then try three diffenet deep learning classification models with and without early stopping and droupout layers and compare the obtained results.
